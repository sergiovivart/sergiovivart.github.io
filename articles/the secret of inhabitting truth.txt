I came to understand this over the last couple months.  
<br>
<br>
Keeping too many secrets over a long time, slowly but surely they will begin to poison drip you, 
and whatever is part of you by association.
This might sound obvious to some, and silly to others... and fair enough.
<br>
Secrecy usually comes with a sense of empowerment. The potential of leveraging whatever information or thing others don't have access to. 
Even if not realized, by itself the juiciness of it all is tempting.
<br>
The diference is real simple, but not so easy.
<br>
<br>
Like love, like compassion and like forgiveness.
Some of the most miraculous things in existence, are not the easiest to practice.
<br>
Especially when the rubber meets the road.
And by that I mean.
<br>
<br>
# How can you love someone, how tried to destroy you.
# How can you be compassionate towards a plant, or an animal or an alien. When they are seen so different from you.
# How can you forgive someone how gave you all the love in the world and them, simply toke it away from you.
<br>
<br>
Not so ease.. I know...But there is hope.
<br>
<br>
I've been surfing the winged realms (cute name right).
Gathering wisdom. And in all honesty. I'm coming up with more question than answers.
<br>
Still, the divine imagination is loud.
Too many secrets will poison your soul.
<br>
And the antidote is truth, with a litle courage on the side.
Because speaking your mind about others is easy enough.
Owning who and what you are is a far greatter challenge. 
<br>
Yet with courage and discernment. It can be the most healing stuff in the world.
That is why i enjoy mirror work once every so often.

<br>
To close this piece, allow me to clarify...
<br>
Do not go around talking to people about your dick size. 
Or how you think your forehead is too wide. im still loving it babe. *wink*
Simply aim to keep secrets out of your relationships.
<br>
Especially if they are based on the power-play or just for the sake of gaining influence via split and conquer (triangulation).
All these things are tenting. I know.
<br>
Drama is tenting, lashing out is tenting cut thing intead on unravelling them is tempting.
And regardless of all these calls,
The truth is. 
A truly transparent relationship is like an oasis with fresh water in a desert.
<br>
Is not easy to find. But, how refreshing it is.
I've gathered so many secrets over the years.
<br>
<br>
Family secrets.
<br>
Friend's secrets and even secrets of enemies.
Secrets i migth have to take to the grave with me.
And my very own secrets, of course.
<br>
<br>
And so the way has tough me.
 The secret of  inhabitting truth.
 Starts with owning your secrets.
